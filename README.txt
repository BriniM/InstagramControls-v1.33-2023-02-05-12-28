This tiny and efficient extension adds standard video playback controls to Instagram™ videos. Normally, all you can do with an Instagram™ video is play or pause it, but this extension will expose the native HTML 5 video player which has a seek bar (aka video scrubber), a volume control, a play/pause button, Picture-In-Picture (floating video) button, fullscreen video button, and on *some* videos it will also display a download button!

The extension automatically runs and works on all web pages that embed Instagram™ videos!

How to use it:
1) Load any web page that contains an Instagram video
2) Click the video to make it play
3) That's it - the extension will automatically detect the video and will reveal the control buttons.

Options:
-Control volume and playback speed via hotkey.
-Remember your volume and playback speed for future videos.
See the extension config page via right-clicking the extension icon in your browser bar, then select "Options". Or, just navigate to chrome://extensions/

Default Hotkeys - customizable via chrome://extensions/shortcuts
Windows / Linux:
Alt + UpArrow: Increase Volume
Alt + DownArrow: Decrease Volume
Ctrl + UpArrow: Increase Playback Speed
Ctrl + DownArrow: Decrease Playback Speed

Mac:
Alt + UpArrow: Increase Volume
Alt + DownArrow: Decrease Volume
Command + UpArrow: Increase Playback Speed
Command + DownArrow: Decrease Playback Speed

Notes:
- After you install the extension, make sure to reload the page for any browser tabs that were opened before installing the extension. The extension will not run in those tabs until you do so.
- The download video button doesn't work on many videos anymore due to recent instagram changes, but it does still work on *some*.
- On pages where instagram auto plays videos as you scroll, such as on your home page feed, make sure to play/pause the video by clicking in the center of the video, instead of using the button at the lower left. Otherwise, when scrolling, the video may not stay paused.

Wondering why the extension is broken so much lately?
Read https://rehfeld.us/browser-extensions/controls-for-instagram/instagram-changes

Issues currently being worked on:
-Remember volume and playback speed not working in some cases.
-The volume mute/buttons on the video vs the Instagram GUI aren't always in sync.
-On stories, you must use the instagram play/pause button because the button on the video doesn't work.
